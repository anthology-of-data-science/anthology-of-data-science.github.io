## Why this anthology

Machine learning is permeating many fields of work. As a new 'system technology'^[Sheikh et al. (2023), _Mission AI: the New System Technology_, [https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-21448-6](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-21448-6)], its expected impact on organizations and society is expected to be of the same magnitude as the steam engine or electricity. As such, more and more professionals are seeking to acquire the necessary understanding and skills to apply machine learning in their day-to-day work. In fact, more people _without_ a background in either computer science or statistics - let alone both - have a need for high-quality, open access content to explore and learn data science by themselves.

Now there is a lot of machine learning learning materials out there, so why this anthology? Based on my experience in teaching professional education course on data & AI, I am continouly challenged to:

- curate content for different professional learning paths, combining various existing open access materials;
- balance between too technical vs too vague, handwaving or even downright wrong;
- problem-based approach: rather than, say, explaining the principles underlying regularization, we choose to demonstrate these principles using the simplest algorithms. With a little math, everyone should be able to understand how LASSO performs regularisation for regression models. With this intuitive understanding, you can move on to more complex algorithms and applications, and intuitively reason where and how to use regularisation.

This anthology was born out of a need to scratch my own itch, namely have a central repository where I can continously collate and update interesting resources. I hope it is also helpful those seeking a stepping stone into the wonderful field of data science. Feel free to drop me a note with suggestions or feedback by reporting an issue.

## How is this anthology set up?

### A selection of the best books

A selection of what I think are [the best textbooks](books.qmd) is provided as a digital bookshelf. All the books included are open access, thanks to their respective authors! They should keep you busy for a while.

### Visualization with Altair

I am a big fan of the [Vega-Altair ecosystem](https://altair-viz.github.io/) for data visualization, because it not only helps me in creating appealing, interactive visualizations, but it also helps me to reason about the data when I am doing exploratory data analysis. A selection of tutorials, blogpost is provided in the section [Visualization with Altair](altair/index.qmd).

### Selected papers & blogposts

Various topics and perspectives data science. Clearly this is an opinionated and very personal selection.

### Notebooks

[Notebooks and explainers](notebooks/index.qmd) for those seeking hands-on examples.
