        "\n",
        "Hamilton is a general-purpose framework to write dataflows using regular Python\n",
        "functions. At the core, each function defines a transformation and its parameters\n",
        "indicates its dependencies. Hamilton automatically connects individual functions into\n",
        "a [directed acyclic graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_acyclic_graph) (DAG)\n",

        "\n",
        "## How Hamilton complements Ibis\n",
        "\n",
        "Hamilton was initially developed to [structure pandas code for a large catalog of\n",
        "features](https://blog.dagworks.io/p/tidy-production-pandas-with-hamilton-3b759a2bf562),\n",
        "and has since been adopted by multiple organizations since, and expanded to cover any\n",
        "python object type (Polars, PySpark, ML Models, Numpy, you custom type, etc). Its syntax\n",
        "encourages users to chunk code into meaningful and reusable components, which facilitates\n",
        "documentation, unit testing, code reviews, and improves iteration speed, and the dev to\n",
        "production process. These benefits directly translate to organizing Ibis code.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Solution 1 – Structure your Ibis code with Hamilton\n",
        "\n",
        "Now, we’ll refactor the above Ibis code to use Hamilton. Users have the flexibility to\n",
        "chunk code (i.e., what the contents of a function is), at the table or the column-level\n",
        "depending on the needed granularity. This modularity is particularly beneficial to Ibis\n",
        "because:\n",
        "\n",
        "- Well-scoped functions with type annotations and docstring are easier to understand for\n",
        "new Ibis users and facilitate onboarding.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Unit testing and data validation becomes easier with smaller expressions. These checks\n",
