        "use pandas in an idiomatic way. This notebook provides guidelines how to\n",
        "do this. It is very opinionated, and based on a functional programming\n",
        "approach to Python. Functional programming defines a computation using\n",
        "expressions and evaluation—often encapsulated in function definitions.\n",
        "It de-emphasizes or avoids the complexity of state change and mutable\n",
        "objects. This tends to create programs that are more succinct and\n",
        "expressive. Since you can’t easily create purely functional programs in\n",
        "Python, we take a hybrid approach, using functional features where we\n",
        "can add clariy or simplify the code. There are several key features of\n",

        "you should be sure to follow.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Whitespace\n",
        "\n",
        "-   Use spaces instead of tabs for indentation.\n",
        "-   Use four spaces for each level of syntactically significant\n",
        "    indenting.\n",
        "-   Lines should be 79 characters in length or less.\n",
        "-   Continuations of long expressions onto additional lines should be\n",
        "    indented by four extra spaces from their normal indentation level.\n",
        "-   In a file, functions and classes should be separated by two blank\n",
        "    lines.\n",
        "-   In a class, methods should be separated by one blank line.\n",
        "-   In a dictionary, put no whitespace between each key and colon, and\n",
        "    put a single space before the corresponding value if it fits on the\n",
        "    same line.\n",
        "-   Put one—and only one—space before and after the `=` operator in a\n",
        "    variable assignment.\n",
        "-   For type annotations, ensure that there is no separation between the\n",
        "    variable name and the colon, and use a space before the type\n",
        "    information.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Naming\n",
        "\n",
        "PEP 8 suggests unique styles of naming for different parts in the\n",
        "language. These conventions make it easy to distinguish which type\n",
        "corresponds to each name when reading code. Follow these guidelines\n",
        "related to naming:\n",
        "\n",
        "-   Functions, variables, and attributes should be in\n",
        "    `lowercase_underscore` format.\n",
        "-   Protected instance attributes should be in `_leading_underscore`\n",
        "    format.\n",
        "-   Private instance attributes should be in\n",
        "    `__double_leading_underscore` format.\n",
        "-   Classes (including exceptions) should be in `CapitalizedWord`\n",
        "    format.\n",
        "-   Module-level constants should be in `ALL_CAPS` format.\n",
        "-   Instance methods in classes should use `self`, which refers to the\n",
        "    object, as the name of the first parameter.\n",
        "-   Class methods should use `cls`, which refers to the class, as the\n",
        "    name of the first parameter.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Expressions and Statements\n",
        "\n",
        "The Zen of Python states: “There should be one—and preferably only\n",
        "one—obvious way to do it.” PEP 8 attempts to codify this style in its\n",
        "guidance for expressions and statements:\n",
        "\n",
        "-   Use inline negation (`if a is not b`) instead of negation of\n",
        "    positive expressions (`if not a is b`).\n",
        "-   Don’t check for empty containers or sequences (like `[]` or `''`) by\n",
        "    comparing the length to zero (if `len(somelist) == 0`). Use\n",
        "    `if not somelist` and assume that empty values will implicitly\n",
        "    evaluate to `False`.\n",
        "-   The same thing goes for non-empty containers or sequences (like\n",
        "    `[1]` or `'hi'`). The statement `if somelist` is implicitly `True`\n",
        "    for non-empty values.\n",
        "-   Avoid single-line if statements, `for` and `while` loops, and except\n",
        "    compound statements. Spread these over multiple lines for clarity.\n",
        "-   If you can’t fit an expression on one line, surround it with\n",
        "    parentheses and add line breaks and indentation to make it easier to\n",
        "    read.\n",
        "-   Prefer surrounding multiline expressions with parentheses over using\n",
        "    the `\\` line continuation character.\n",

        "#### Imports\n",
        "\n",
        "PEP 8 suggests some guidelines for how to import modules and use them in\n",
        "your code:\n",
        "\n",
        "-   Always put import statements (including from `x import y`) at the\n",
        "    top of a file.\n",
        "-   Always use absolute names for modules when importing them, not names\n",
        "    relative to the current module’s own path. For example, to import\n",
        "    the foo module from within the bar package, you should use from bar\n",
        "    import foo, not just import foo.\n",
        "-   If you must do relative imports, use the explicit syntax\n",
        "    `from . import foo`.\n",
        "-   Imports should be in sections in the following order:\n",
        "    -   standard library modules\n",
        "    -   third-party modules\n",
        "    -   your own modules.\n",
        "\n",
        "    Each subsection should have imports in alphabetical order.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Use code formatters\n",
        "\n",
        "It is recommended to use a code formatter like\n",
