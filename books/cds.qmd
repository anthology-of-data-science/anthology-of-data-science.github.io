title: Critical Data Studies
description: |
    This book provides a glossary for the field, consisting of 413 entries about key terms. Each entry sets out a definition, a descriptive overview, and further reading. The text is designed to be a pedagogic resource that enables students and researchers to look up terms that might be used in the classroom or in publications but in a way shorn of a detailed explanation of their meaning, and to act as a guide for discovering ideas, concepts, and methods that might be of value in their studies and analysis.
